Game Objectives:

Deisign a framework that will allow the player to place a ship along a coast line, and give the ship
a course and a speed.

The ship will then continue along the course defined, automatically avoiding any obstacles such as a small island.

If the ship encounters another ship from the same country - it will report it - and continue sailing.

If the ship encounters another ship from a different country - if they are at war - the ship will report the encounter,
and stop for further instructions.
