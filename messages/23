<P>Stars are now implemented.<br> From here I am now going to concentrate on trying again to get the datafile<br> reloading routine OUT of the screen painting routine - so it does'nt hit<br> the server every time you update your window.<br> <p> Next I'll be experimenting with "mouse over" events to try and select a grid<br> square to use as a "zoom in" target.<br>
