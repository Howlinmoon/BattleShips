<P>BB = 28 knots max (although some could make up to 32). This speed would consume a lot of fuel; normal cruising speed would be 18 - 20 knots.
<P>CA & CL = 32 knots max, 14 cruising
<P>CV = 32 knots max (although some could make 34). 20 cruising.
<P>DD & FF = 38 knots max (Japanese) or 36 knots max (everyone else). About 22 cruising.
<P>(Note that FFs were reclassified "Destroyer Escorts" during WWII, then reclassified back to FFs afterward).
<P>I posted info on subs before. I think they make about 10 knots submerged and 25 on the surface. The Cod website and the Mather website probably have good info for sub and freighter speeds. Right now I've gotta run.
<P>NOTE: ALL SPEEDS SLOWER IN WWI.
