LINKNAME>CINCPAC - Battle of Midway
LINKURL>http://beholder.dhs.org:4080/midway.zip
<P>Just for the heck of it - I dug through my old coco floppies and found my copy of "CINCPAC" - a really good battle of Midway Program purchased by Dave I think in the early 80s. Make a directory - unzip this into it - and run "coco". then just load "midway" and run...
<P>Unfortunately it is VERY fast on modern hardware (the emulator) but the game is turn based so it does'nt streak past you ;-)
