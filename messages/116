<P>> Actually most fields will be fine for most ships. Except for
<BR>&gt; CVs and cargo ships just about all classes of ships sometimes carried
<BR>&gt; torpedoes. BBs, BCs, CAs and CLs definitely did. The main fields that
<BR>&gt; will be different are those associated with submarines and CVs. Perhaps
<BR>&gt; the fields for main guns and turrets could track maximum depth, number
<BR>&gt; of aircraft in hangar, aircraft fuel & ammunition, battery capacity,
<BR>&gt; and such. <p> I think you are forgetting the underlying design philosphy we are going by right now - Keep it Simple. Yes, I am aware that not just Submarines carried torpedoes, they were the main armament of PT Boats for example. BUT, for now the only vessel I want carrying them is Subs. BB's also carried floatplanes but I dont want to deal with that anytime soon - so in the near future just CV's will have planes.<br> I am simply setting attainable shortrange goals by using these limits - and hopefully within a month we'll have some rudimentary combat going on. If we dont set these limits - we might not see the first combat for a year... or more... if ever.
<P>&gt; BTW History Channel showed a 2-hour documentry about the Bismark
<BR>&gt; over the weekend. It really got me psyched! <p> I saw this - I had assumed it was the one you saw before - I loved it!
