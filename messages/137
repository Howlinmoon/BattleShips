<P>Status of Taskforces: The Task Force management page is now being dynamically generated every impulse - just like the ship status page. It does NOT auto-refresh since that would be annoying ;-) Existing task forces are now listed on that page - right now you STILL can only add new ones - soon you will be able to add/remove ships from task forces - and then later, be able to delete taskforces. Finally - I'll work on assigning rallying points for task forces and task force waypoints and possibly formations. As soon as everything except formations is done - it will be time to focus on a rough java map AND combat. Personally I want to implement rudimentary combat first - since it will be quicker to have something to show for my efforts - and I want to sink the Hood :-)
