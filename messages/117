<P>I agree the easiest way to deal with airplanes is to put them on CVs only. In fact, we should probably not even try to keep track of individual planes, just send out a squadron and keep track of total # of planes. It either gets lost or ot finds a target. When it reaches its target some planes are shot down and the rest conduct attacks. Then the squadron tries to return to the CV. The attack can be a lot like Avalon Hill's Midway . . . each plane scores a hit or miss. Torpedo hits will be like any other torp, dive bomb hit will be like a shell of a certain size.
<P>I think the easiest way to deal with torps is to put them on all ships, instead of having special rules for submarines. But it doesn't matter to me.
<P>IMO the best "keep it simple" philosophy we could have right now is to adopt a strictly WWI game. We could play the entire naval war with just surface combat . . . no submarines or airplanes . . . and we could encompass 90% of the war. Most WWI battles were just surface ships firing guns at each other.
<P>How about that Bismark! It had <I>automated</I> anti-aircraft guns! The Germans really should have tested those better . . . assuming the guns gave the Bismark immunity from air attacks was a fatal mistake.
<P>That History Channel show told me all sorts of things I had not known before.
