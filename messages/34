<P>> This weekend on the History Channel I caught a show called "Battleships"
<BR>&gt; I think, and watching it made me yearn for a WWIIera Naval game
<P>I saw it last month and thought the same thing. I also saw Horatio Hornblower, which made me want to play Wooden Ships and Iron Men and Ironclads.
<P>&gt; It's amazing that you would mention something similar. Ever since
<BR>&gt; the Coco era - I have been wanting to write the computer equivalent
<BR>&gt; of "Submarine!"
<P>I started to write a WWII naval game for the CoCo, but there wasn't enough memory to do it right. I wanted multiple players, which would be the big advantage of doing it on the Internet.
<P>&gt; We could simply create a nice ocean in 3d more or less as the map
<BR>&gt; - and have a much simpler detailed land mass(es) surrounding it.
<BR>&gt; Hmmm - maybe make the countries (players) as Islands in the sea?
<P>Personally I would like to start with a pure combat game. We could include WWI and WWII naval battles. Except for aircraft carriers, the strategy and tactics were pretty much the same in both wars. We could start out with real ships. The players would have to worry about fuel, ammunition, and other supplies carried by freighters, but not money. They could deploy their fleets and convoys however they like. They would have their own battles like Dogger Bank, Jutland, Guadal Canal, Shurigao Straights, and of course Sink the Bismark!
<P>I am already looking forward to my reign of terror, scourge of the North Atlantic, at the helm of the Bismark. ;-)
<P>This game would have relatively simple sighting rules. The only factors would be time of day, fog, submarines, and radar. No need to worry about sensor tech, scanners, ECMs, ECCMs, cloaking devices, and all that other complicated stuff. If you can see them then they can see you (except for occasions when one side has radar and the other doesn't, or submarines at periscope depth).
<P>The weapons will be just guns and torpedoes, so the AI will be simple. We will assume all ships have radios. The player can see everything his ships see, and issue orders to any ship at any time. The only exception will be submerged submarines, which cannot report sightings or receive orders until they surface (at least to periscope depth).
<P>A Battleship vs Battleship game could cover the era from about 1915 to 1942. The second step would be to add aircraft, which would not be too difficult. That would carry us to the end of WWII. The next stage would be to add economics, where players would design and build their own ships. And finally we could add a "World Generator" which would allow players to generate custom (or random) maps of the world where their battles take place.
<P>Jim, do you still have "Submarine!" in your collection? I'd like to play a few games to get the feel for it again. I'd like to play "Battlewagon" too.
