<P>I just sent the U.S.S. Monotor to intercept the Tramp Steamer and it has responded to orders. Very nice!
<P>It sould not be too difficult to calculate a real intercept course, which figures out where a ship will be instead of where it is now. This is much easier with surface ships at constant speed than with spaceships which are accellerating. I will get on the math the next chance I get. It is a matter of finding the X,Y coordinates where two circles intersect (two points) then choosing the correct one of the two. It should not be bad.
<P>Note that an actual "Intercept Mission" will be more difficult. The player should presume that a ship on an intercept mission will watch for its target to change course, then autonomously change its own course to pursue. This requires a little bit more AI, since it will need to keep an eye on its target.
<P>One other possibility for the future: What if we give the players the tools to calculate the course for themselves, but we don't actually do it for them? They have a map on their monitor which allows them to mark points, then they push instruments (like a compass and protractor) around on the map, calculate the course they want, and then issue the orders. It would be more realistic, offer a greater challenge, and require more skill than just clicking on a button that says "Intercept: Bismark."
