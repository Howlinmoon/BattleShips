<P>> YIKES! This scares me just looking at it - the WORK involved
<BR>&gt; is enough to give me a headache... I'm about two evolutionary steps
<BR>&gt; behind you right now ;-) I do like the looks of it - but please dont
<BR>&gt; expect this level of detail for sometime yet...
<P>Golly, I didn't mean to frighten you. The previous page was submitted for discussion and comments only. The concept is similar to Battlewagon's SSDs. It has more technical detail but less graphics (i.e. none). Is it feasable?
<P>We can get a basic idea of how it will look before actually creating it. Once we do that, then I can start to do some of the research and conversions to include many more ship classes for the database. That could keep me busy for weeks!
<P>More importantly, if we decide that this format is workable I could begin to develop the algorithms for hit location and armor penetration. These formulas will take some time to develop.
<P>Even with text based map and SSDs, this game will be more realistic than most naval games out there. It is very well designed.
<P>We really need to come up with better terminology though . . . all this talk of SSDs and impulses is giving *me* a Starfleet headache. ;-)
