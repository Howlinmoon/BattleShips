<P>In reading up on Military Naval History, I have come across some very interesting information. Everyone knows about Count Stauffenberg's attempt to kill Hitler in 1944, but imagine if he had done it in 1939 . . . and succeeded? The war in Europe would be under way already, with the momentum favoring the Axis Powers, and it could certainly go on without Hitler. This is not too far fetched.
<P>Hitler's heir apparent was Goering, still not the brightest bulb on the tree but lightyears ahead of der Fuerer. Goering would surely have avoided Hitler's two greatest mistakes: loosing touch with Mussolini and attacking Russia in Operation Barbarossa.
<P>Barbarossa was essentially a Hitler tantrum, and Mussolini's attack on Greece was a stupid idea that could have been prevented by better leadership. Before that both Russia and Greece were more inclined toward the Axis than the Allies.
<P>Imagine WWII with the Russians helping the Japanese to attack China instead of America. With Italy *and* Greece on his side, Goering would dominate the Mediteranian. Pearl Harbor would be delayed for a year or more, keeping the Americans out of it, and Germany would get access to huge supplies of petroleum and metals.
<P>Remove Russia and Greece from the Allies and add them to the Axis, and keep America out of the war for another year.
<P>With one small change of history, World War II would have been a fair fight! What a campaign game!
