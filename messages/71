<P>The ship status page is being worked on - the names of the ships will be (are) links to their own individual status pages where I am planning on allowing modifications to the ships course, speed, etc etc to take place. If you try to select a ship right now and the link is broken - it's because I am still working on it. Eventually it will take you to the proper page...
