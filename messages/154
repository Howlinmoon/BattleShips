<P>A Text Based SSD might look like this. If we can adopt a database something like this, there could be a web page where the player could look at this data in real time. Then we could do damage allocation and actually sink a ship!
<P>For now we would either assume all hits penetrate armor, or we would use super - simple armor formulas like in Battlewagon.
