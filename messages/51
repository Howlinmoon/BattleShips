<P>Ok - going about it a bit backwards from GO - what is functional right at this moment is the ability to insert a new ship into the database. At the moment - nothing is done with it since I was still rusty from not programming this sort of functionality in quite a while.<br> In fact - as of right now there is no nice html page to even view the existing ships in the test database - but that will be next. <p> However - what you can do is examine the sql database directly via my <a href="http://battleship.dhs.org:4080/cgi-bin/myadmin/myadmin.cgi">"myadmin" interface for mySql</a> but PLEASE do not modify the database in any form from that interface. I am still working on locking it down via permissions but right now it is open<p> Just click on the login button - then click the down arrow to select "test" instead of "mysql" - then click on the "sql interface" button.<p> In the text area - type the following:<br> select * from master_ship_chart<br> and then click on the submit query button - that should list out the contents of the master ship chart. <p> Further html pages will be added soon - plus a rudimentary impulser that you can stop (pause) and restart at will for examining data at your leisure w/out it becoming immediately outdated by the next impulse. Stay Tuned...
