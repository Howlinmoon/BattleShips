<P>> DO we want to allow different guns in the same turret
<BR>&gt; to fire at different targets?
<P>No, this would be unrealistic.
<P>&gt; Personally - I'm not sure why we are even going
<BR>&gt; the extra step and including volleys - why not
<BR>&gt; simply at the start of the combat routine -
<BR>&gt; initialize shots_hit to 0, and then increment
<BR>&gt; it by one for every shot from every ship that
<BR>&gt; hits - and for every hit - save this information.
<P>This will work just fine. In this case you need to keep track of four things: target ship ID, range, gun type, and bearing from the target to the firing ship, for each shot that hits. I suggested the volley concept because most of this information will be duplication . . . if the Bismark's main guns hit the Hood with seven shells in an impulse, then those four fields will be exactly the same for all seven shots_hit.
<P>It's fine with me if you want to keep track of individual shells instead of grouping them into volleys.
