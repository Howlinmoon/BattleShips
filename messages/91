<P>I just <A HREF = "http://204.210.200.63:4080/game_design/ship_status.html">launched a few ships</A>. They are at realistic speeds. As you can see, except for the submerged U-Boat, they all skip pixels at the current granularity.
<P>If we are happy with the 3 impulses per minute speed and the 3:1 time scale, then we CAN compensate for the skipped pixels mathematically. For example, if we want to see if a ship hit a mine we don't need the ship to actually spend an impulse in the same pixel; we could check to see if the ship passed through the mine pixel the same mathematical way VGAP does it.
<P>Can anyone else think of negative consequences to having some ships skip pixels?
