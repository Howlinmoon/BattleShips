<P>As was the waypoint management before it - taskforces are proceeding slowly. ALOT of time is spent on the interface - the actual coding of the taskforce management will go much quicker. Right now - from the semi-"display model" task force management page, you can "create" a taskforce. This new task force is then sent to the impulser for inclusion in the master list - and it acknowledges receiving it. As of this moment tho - the impulser then ignores taskforces after acknowledging it received the addition.
