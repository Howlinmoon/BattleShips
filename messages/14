<P>Oh - one thing I forgot to mention - I continue to use the command line front end "mysql" to create tables and other db maintenance - and as for easily creating tables - I do something like this<p> <p> mysql < <a href="/game_design/make_planet_chart">make_planet_chart</a><br> And it creates the db in a split second. I just edit the text file if I need to rebuild the db in some fashion after dropping it...<br> I have another one for the star table also...
<P>
