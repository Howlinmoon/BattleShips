<P>as my post says...
<P>Now then - how would we like to start? Every country has x billbucks to start with - and can design a their own navy? I'd like something where you buy a stock BB hull - for xx billbucks - and then you apply layers of armor plate to it for more billbucks - throw some engines in it for even more, add armament and magazine size - and then the java ship design program spits out that your proposed BB is too heavy for the amount of water it displaces and would sink instantly. So - you tweak here - trim there - then once it's floating - you can fine adjust it's makeup till the speed is where you want it.
<P>We could design it with an interface not totally unlike a spreadsheet - in that it would give real time calculations of your mass, buoyancy, speed etc etc.
<P>We really would'nt have to worry about gravimetrics and the constants of the universe, we could simply determine how much offense and defense potential has gathered in a spot when you encounter the enemy - determine if surprise gives either side a first fire advantage - and if not - conduct attacks simultaneously.
<P>Combat would be resolved simply - a DD meeting a BB in a "fair" fight will die - but the BB may take some damage that will be needed to be repaired - or on it's next engagement it may have a slightly lower offsensive/defensive rating.
<P>Of course this is assuming the DD even hurt it - quite possibly the DD would'nt touch the BB resulting in simply throwing away the DD.
<P>We'd have to have some sort of simple economy - something to require sending convoys across the ocean. If nothing else - we could simply make getting X% of the convoy intact to it's destination - and others would be required to try and stop it.
<P>Be nice to figure out how to take planes into account too - instead of attempting to model real planes or making their design process as complicated as the naval ships - I'd suggest something like stocking 3 types of planes - scouts (PBY), Fighters (Corsairs) and Torpedo/Bombers (SBDs) And then simply assign a price to them - *maybe* have different grades of pilots for different costs - but of course make them a rare and finite commodity.
<P>Or - possibly give the pilots slight enhancements to their skills as they survive sorties.
<P>I like having one plane do the dual role of carrying bombs or torpedoes - since this might give me a chance to catch the enemy while changing over like in Midway :-)
<P>So - what do you think? (Can you tell I think this is a great idea?!)
<P>Jim
