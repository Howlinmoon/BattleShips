<P>Yes, I know that page. It leads to the best mathematical treatise of gun / armor simulation I have ever seen. <A HREF = "http://www.skypoint.com/members/jbp/gunarmor.htm">Guns 'n Armor</A> is how I plan on doing a lot of the armor calculations. The ship data on that page is really excellent, unfortunately it does not give much info about non Japanese ships.
<P><A HREF = "http://www.teleport.com/~chalu/index3.htm">Naval and Military Affairs Page</A> has links to many good essays, pictures, and other useful information. I found <A HREF = "http://www.richthofen.com/scheer/">Admiral Scheer's Book</A> about naval combat in WWI to be particularly enlightening. This essay <A HREF = "http://www.teleport.com/~chalu/could.htm">Could Germany Have Won the Second World War?</A> is the basis for the "balanced WWII scenario" I proposed a few weeks ago.
<P><A HREF = "http://warships1.com/index_ships.htm">Warships pf the World</A> has the most comprehensive data for all the ships we need of all nations. This is my source for the ships I posted previously.
<P><A HREF = "http://www.wtj.com/games/battlefleet/">Battlefleet</A> is a miniatures naval combat game that you can download for free. It looks like a lot of fun! Unfortunately the rules seem to cover the period after the Civil War and before WWI . . . the rules for actually playing WWI are not written yet. Does anyone want to get together to play some Battlefleet sometime?
<P>Finally, <A HREF = "http://nxn.netgate.net/games2_XwarX.html">Free Web Games</A> has a section of wargames you can play on the web much like we are designing. Most of them require multiple players, but <A HREF = "http://members.aol.com/hlefort/">Santa Cruz Carrier Battle</A> is a free war game that you can play solo. I think our game is already superior, but I am biased.
