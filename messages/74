<P>> It would probably be good to maintain a table of the ID's of
<BR>&gt; all ships that are currently in sight, not just a tally of how many
<BR>&gt; there are. That would be handy for players as well as for the Host
<BR>&gt; program. 
<P>I am already maintaing an array of distances from ship to ship - it's a simple thing to compare then with sighting range or gunner range or what have you...<br>
<BR>&gt; It could be tricky to determine where "enemy territorial
<BR>&gt; warters" are. Most of the Earth's surface is in International
<BR>&gt; Waters; territorial waters are limited to within a few miles of the
<BR>&gt; shore, as I recall. I was going to assume countries with very square borders like in your demo map - and then it's a simple matter of checking the x,y co-ords to see if you are within say, 10 nmiles of a countries border.<br>
<BR>&gt; IMO a ship observing radio silence can't report its position,
<BR>&gt; or what ships it can see, or any other current data. All it can do
<BR>&gt; is listen for instructions until it gets the order to break silence
<BR>&gt; and report (or some condition in its standing orders tells it to break
<BR>&gt; silence). Until then its status page can only give last known position,
<BR>&gt; standing orders, last know course & speed, and a THEORETICAL position
<BR>&gt; as a stickpin on a map in the Admiral's office. <p> This is exactly my plans for radio silence. And running submerged.<br> And the admiral will have to *HOPE* that his ship is continuing to heed radio silence rules and the rumor of it's demise is only just that ;-)
