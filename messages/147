<P>You will no doubt notice what appears to be a delay in pages being displayed - what is happening is - before the www server would serve half of a page and then pause while something was acknowledged - then print the acknowledgment and the remaining half of the www page. Proxy servers however - can't serve just half of a page - so they WAIT until the entire page is served from the remote server - THEN they relay it to you. So - what is happening is you dont SEE the page loading halfway - pausing - and then finishing - you just get the end result.
