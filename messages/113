<P>> By Monday hopefully waypoints will be at least
<BR>&gt; partially operational.
<P>Great! I am itching to work on combat, too.
<P>&gt; There is a slight bug in the speed limiter I implemented
<BR>&gt; yesterday - I have the limiter BEFORE the accellerator...
<BR>&gt; which explains why my subs can do 15 submerged when the
<BR>&gt; speed limit is 10...
<P>Yeah, I wondered why I was able to increase speed for one impulse, then get knocked back down. It was very strange.
<P>How come my ships get knocked down after one impulse, but your don't?
