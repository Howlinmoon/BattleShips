<P>As an update - what I am planning on doing is generating a "scaling factor"<br> by taking 250 (1/2 the x and y dimensions) - dividing it by 10million - and<br> then multiplying each co-ordinate in turn by this number - and adding it to<br> 250,250 prior to plotting it. This in theory should map the negative values<br> correctly in the java display - since I can only plot Quadrant II values.<br> (Assuming quadrants are number from N/E clockwise to N/W)<br>
