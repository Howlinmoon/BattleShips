<P>> Instead of "ship_status.html" - use "ship_status2.html".
<BR>&gt; There are no convenient links to it - but It's up right now and being
<BR>&gt; updated - take a look and see if the numbers appear reasonable. I
<BR>&gt; have no idea...
<P>One of the Column headings is missing; the "See other ship" multiplier. As a consequence all of the columns after that are mislabeled. But it looks like all the numbers are believable, including longitude & latitude.
