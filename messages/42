<P>> This brings up a VERY critical point. Should we use "simulated"
<BR>&gt; weather for campaign games, where random number generators create
<BR>&gt; occasional rain, fog, snow, and such? Or should we try to use REAL
<BR>&gt; weather? That would mean some SERIOUS research! Imagine trying to
<P>&gt; If we institute random weather then the weather itself could
<BR>&gt; change history. What if there is a hurricane on the day the Battle
<P>I would definitely vote that we would have to randomize weather - but in such a fashion that we could "forecast" the upcoming weather conditions. In other words - it would be kinda silly to have the temp be sunny and 70F one day - and 30s and snowy the following w/out having the onboard meteorologist noting that a really nasty looking cloud formation is rolling in the from the southwest or whatever. We should make it random - but realistic. This will also be a factor in determining how large our map is - if it's more than just lake-sized - then we may want to determine weather in different parts of it. I'd allow the forecasters to come up with 3day forecasts but with the accuracy dropping off quickly after the first day... and maybe only having an 80% chance that the first day's forecast would be completely as predicted.
