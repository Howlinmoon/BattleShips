<P>Seeing that any new arrivals to this forum may be slightly taken back by the quantity of messages on this discussion forum, I felt it was needed to post an introductory summary message.<p> You may recall that last year Mike and myself came up with a cool idea for a www based space game of Galactic Conquest. The subject matter has since proven to be far more complicated than anticipated, so we have scaled back somewhat and are now attempting to create a WWI/II era naval game.<br> When this game is fully functioning, the participants will be able to design their own fleets and arrange their ships into convoys assigned with various tasks such as taking X tankers from country A to country B while escorted by a task force. Another will probably develop a fleet of similar size, except their purpose will be to try and stop the first player from reaching his goals.<p> Unlike traditional games - when you are through for the day - the GAME itself will keep going with out you - following your last commands. The players will not have to micro-manage their fleet movements like in VGA Planets, but will instead pre-program their fleets with destinations and "standing orders" on how to react to a finite list of potential possibilities. The ships will then be launched with the player remaining behind and the only communications with the ships will be done with radio traffic - simulated by this www interface. It is quite possible that a player involved in a fracas may send out of a convoy of ships and 2 days later (real time) get a message back from other convoy that debris from the first one has been sighted. It's also possible that word may never come back concerning the first convoy if it was attacked and sunk before any distress calls were sent out. In that case - their status would be recorded simply as "MIA presumed KIA".<p> Where we are today:<br> Right now we are still in the game design process - hence the purpose of this discussion forum - it's for discussing the game in process. A message board for in game comments will be unveiled at a later date. As of right now, a main program dubbed "the impulser" is running on the machine hosting this message forum, and it processes all the events in the game every 20 seconds of real time. As you can see by the impulse number on the <a href="http://beholder.dhs.org:4080/game_design/ship_status.html">ship status page</a>, the impulser has been running for some time. Until recently, all we were able to do is create unarmed test ships, launch them and manually change their courses and speeds. This is being done to exercise the base mechanics of the game and to discover any problems with our computational formulas.<br> Eventually (read hopefully soon) we plan on being able to launch ships based on real life data and have them do combat with each other. For now the ships are sailing around unarmed and unarmored.<br> The latest update to the impulser has enabled a form of setting and following waypoints. As of this writing - there appears to still be a problem of sorts, observed by noticing that a ships ETA is not changing, even tho it is following a waypoint. The ETA is supposed to be calculated instantaneously for each impulse showing how many more impulses are required before a ship arrives at it's current waypoint at the present speed.<p> What we would like from you is to review the other messages (not necessarily all of them!) and to post any comments or suggestions you may have. If you would also like to help out on this project - your participation is heartily encouraged. I can create shell accounts on the host machine if programming is desired - or you can help create the required html front ends needed for the game.<p> Thank you for stopping by!
