<P>I think we need to start at approximately the same place we started the previous game. We need to determine the granularity of the Universe. We will decide the time scale factor and the maximum resolution available on the maps.
<P>Factors for determining time scale:
<P>Depending on your perspective, WWI and WWII both took 4-7 years (both wars were well under way before America joined).
<P>IMO, if you wanted to play a single battle like "Jutland" or "Midway" you should be able to finish it in one evening, perhaps 4 hours. That suggests a time scale of about 3:1.
<P>If you want to play a mini campaign, like "Sink the Bismark!" or "Pursuit of the Graf Spee" or "Both Battles of Guadalcanal" it should take a weekend, or perhaps a week. That's a time scale of about 4:1 or 5:1.
<P>If you want to play a whole World War, it should take about a year, maybe a little less. That would be a time scale of about 5:1.
<P>Any of these time scales is much slower than Galactic Overlords 10:1 scale. The game will still take place at a faster pace, though, since our ships don't have to accellerate/decellerate for YEARS before reaching their destination.
<P>I am inclined toward a 3:1 time scale. It will make long journeys across the ocean kind of boring, but it will make the battles more exciting. Let's see what that does:
<P>A really fast ship could cross the Atlantic in four real days. A convoy could probably do it in 5 - 6 depending on whether they zig-zag to avoid torpedoes. A game driving a convoy across the Atlantic would take less than two days of player time.
<P>A battle like "Jutland" or "Midway" that took most of a day would be over in about 4 hours of player time.
<P>The Bismark's reign of terror, which lasted about a week of real time, would be a little more than two days of player time.
<P>All of WWI or WWII would take 14-18 months of player time . . . about the same as a slow game of VGA Planets.
<P>As I recall, a really fast BB gun could fire 3 rounds per minute, equating to 9 rounds per player minute per gun. Of course most of these shots are misses. We need to consider our refresh rate when looking at this factor.
<P>So what does everyone else think? Is a 3:1 time scale acceptable or not? Should we go with a refresh rate of three times per minute, or maybe something faster?
