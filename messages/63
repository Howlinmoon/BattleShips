<P>> I came up with the formula for heading & bearing on Tuesday,
<BR>&gt; but then my computer crashed (damn Microsoft) before I submitted it.
<BR>&gt; I was out all day yesterday and won't be around much today or tomorrow,
<BR>&gt; but I'll try to recreate it ASAP.
<P>STILL waiting for this formula.<br> The project is on standby until this and the rudder issue I mentioned last week is resolved.
