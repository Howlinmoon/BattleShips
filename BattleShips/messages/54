<P>Ok - there is now a very rudimentary ship status page - it's far from finished but I stopped working on it once it started displaying legible output. It will be tableized and those long nasty co-ords will be truncated somewhat for display purposes later. For now tho - you can see the ships you add and the relative ranges to/from each other.
