<P>> I suggest we create a very simple form of ground combat, something
<BR>&gt; like Supreme Ruler or even Sim City, to be used in campaign games.
<BR>&gt; The simulation will keep track of numerical odds, and occasionally
<BR>&gt; send the players a message like "Iwo Jima is under attack! Enemy
<BR>&gt; forces are superior by 1,000,000 tons of troops and supplies!" <p> This sounds ok to me - just got to watch out for the Barbarian hordes and those pesky wheat eating rats! <p> Speaking of Supreme Ruler - that reminds me - we need to take something into account that we did'nt need to worry about for G.O. - namely weather.
