<P>Ok - I fixed the problems adding the extra field "ship class" brought onboard, and for good measure I added two more columns to the ship status page. NOTE as of this moment ALL of these three new columns for show only - they ARE saved to the db and restored from it - but right now there is no way to change their contents and nothing queries against them. But that will change hopefully later today. Once I have these three columns functional - they I shall turn my attention to a first attempt at a map.<p>
