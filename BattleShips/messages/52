<P>I checked the database to see that Jim's Bismark has set sale, so to speak. Great!
<P>In my last message last week I said something misleading. I said you could set a sighting distance in nautical miles, the proceeded to give a sighting formula in pixels. If you put SIGHT_DISTANCE = 20 in that formula then you can barely see two nautical miles. The whole world is in a fog bank.
<P>To get actual nautical miles, multiply SIGHT_DISTANCE by a factor of ten. Twenty NM, a more realistic sighting distance, is 200 pixels.
