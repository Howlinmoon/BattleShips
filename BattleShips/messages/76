<P>> Now - when the secondary page is accessed
<BR>&gt; - there is a delay while loading. This
<BR>&gt; delay is caused by it setting a semaphore
<BR>&gt; for the impulser to get it to write the current
<BR>&gt; data to the sql server.
<P>Great. I'll go check it out immediately.
<P>&gt; By The way - how do you like the new background?
<BR>&gt; Hopefully easier to read over.
<P>Yes, this is much easier to read, thanks.
