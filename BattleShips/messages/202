<P>Ask and you shall receive. I added a typical WWII Liberty Ship to the Master Ship Table. With no armor and a top speed of 11 knots it shouldn't be too different from the cargo ships of WWI, except maybe in armament. The weapons are so light that we don't even have them on the table yet (waiting until we start including secondary guns). In practice, the only damage a cargo ship might do would be to a surfaced submarine or a low flying airplane.
<P>As long as we aren't letting ships fire the tiny guns the Liberty Ship should be adequate for representing any cargo ship we like. Details are <A HREF = "http://www.maritime.org/hnsa-jbrown.htm">here</A>. Note that this class could be used as either a cargo carrier or a troop transport.
