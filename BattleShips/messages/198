<P>This past week has seen a lot of progress. The <A HREF ="http://204.210.200.85:4080/old/game_design/ship_status.html">Ship's Status Page</A> and the Crude text Map pages combine to make a game that is reasonably playable. Anyone who hasn't tried it should go there and check them out. Drive the ships around, aim their guns, and open fire! It's kind of fun!
