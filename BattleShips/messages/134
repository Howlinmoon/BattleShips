<P>The above was a great message to help people get up to speed on where we are as of today. To help get people involved, I would like to solicit input on a simple point from the message.
<P>&gt; The ships will then be launched with the player remaining behind and
<BR>&gt; the only communications with the ships will be done with radio traffic
<BR>&gt; - simulated by this www interface. It is quite possible that a player
<BR>&gt; involved in a fracas may send out of a convoy of ships and 2 days
<BR>&gt; later (real time) get a message back from other convoy that debris
<BR>&gt; from the first one has been sighted. It's also possible that word
<BR>&gt; may never come back concerning the first convoy if it was attacked
<BR>&gt; and sunk before any distress calls were sent out.
<P>Lately I have been considering at least two levels of play: a strategic level exactly as Jim described to be used for campaign games, and a tactical level to be used for limited scenarios. The main reason for this is that while we have been playing around with the current interface, I have discovered that driving ships around on the map is FUN! I think players would like some scenarios that allow them to micromanage a few ships.
<P>My proposal is that the stratetgic level would be used to simulate an entire war, or a theater of a war, that would take many months or a year to play. This would typically be a game with many players, like a VGAP campaign.
<P>The tactical level would be used to simulate a single battle or more complex scenario, in which the player can consider himself to be "aboard" one of the ships in one or more Task Forces. For example, "North Atlantic Convoy Raider" would be a great solo scenario in which the player commands the Bismark and Prinz Eugen while the host moves autonomous British convoys and searching battleships around the map. The player would be able to micromanage the Bismark & Prinz Eugen if he wanted to, and never worry about losing contact with them.
<P>The tactical level would also be good for one-on-one battles like Midway, Jutland, Dogger Bank, Coral Sea, Guadalcanal, etc.. Battles like these will only require two players and one or two days to play. It would be a lot more fun to micromanage the ships at Jutland (setting courses, picking targets, etc.) instead of just sending them out with standing orders and hoping they come back.
<P>If we did this, then realistic scenarios will require some "fog of war." Thus ships would sometimes get their orders confused. The probability would depend on the tech level (year and country) involved. A WWI British Admiral at Jutland who sent an order for one of his ships to open fire on the Scharnhorts and another to fire on the Moltke never knew for sure what the ships would do. They might both fire on the Moltke. But in WWII signaling was much better and a mistake like that would be much less likely.
<P>Both the strategic and tactical level would use exactly the same simulation. The only difference is that the tactical level would give the player up-to-date information a lot more often, but he would be controlling far fewer ships for a shorter time.
<P>What does everyone else think?
