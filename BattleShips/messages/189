<P>The Bismark Class is ready for testing, if you feel inclined. Between its longer range guns and faster speed, it should be able to take on every ship on the map at the same time. To account for superior technology its ratings for optics and crew skill should be about 10-12.
<P>If we factored in its armor, these WWI ships probably couldn't touch it.
<P>If you want to check data on the Bismark, the ship is <A HREF = "http://warships1.com/GERbb08_Bismarck.htm">here</A> and the guns are <A HREF = "http://www.warships1.com/Weapons/WNGER_15-52_skc34.htm">here</A>.
