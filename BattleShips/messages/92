<P>Unfortunately it's not working very well just yet - but I wanted a rough ship class selector for keying course, speed and if appropriate, depth changes. Right now as of tonight it crashes the impulser when you add a ship - I'll fix that tomorrow soon as I can find a chance. The add routine DOES work tho - you just can't see the results...
