<P>> I think we need to start at approximately the same place we started
<BR>&gt; the previous game. We need to determine the granularity of the Universe.
<BR>&gt; We will decide the time scale factor and the maximum resolution available
<BR>&gt; on the maps. <p> I agree this is a good place to start<br>
<P>&gt; IMO, if you wanted to play a single battle like "Jutland"
<BR>&gt; or "Midway" you should be able to finish it in one evening,
<BR>&gt; perhaps 4 hours. That suggests a time scale of about 3:1. <p> By this I am assuming you mean the tactical engagement - the entire operation took more than 12 realtime hours. If I we were to re-create Midway - I'd like to start from when both sides were actively looking for the other - not after they had found each other and were preparing airstrikes.<br>
<P>&gt; I am inclined toward a 3:1 time scale. It will make long journeys
<BR>&gt; across the ocean kind of boring, but it will make the battles more
<BR>&gt; exciting. Let's see what that does: <p> 3:1 sounds fine to me.<br>
<P>
