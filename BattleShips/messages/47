<P>Okay, I agree with Jim here. Now consider this suggestion:
<P>We have weather conditions all over the map predetermined with 100% certainty at least a week ahead of time, but each player's meterologists has to interpret the data. Thus, even though the host computer KNOWS that a thunderstorm is coming, the British meteorologists might say "Scattered showers tomorrow," while the German meterologist says "A Hurricaine is coming!"
