<P>In 20th century warfare, there are seven major roles for ships:
<P>1) Get supplies to your troops, factories, and your allies.
<P>2) Prevent your enemy from getting supplies to his troops, factories, and allies.
<P>3) Land invasion forces in enemy territory.
<P>4) Prevent your enemy from landing invasion forces in your territory.
<P>5) Attack your enemy's land based facilities. Aircraft carriers do this much better than battleships.
<P>6) Prevent your enemy from attacking your land based facilities.
<P>7) Attack your enemy's warships directly.
<P>It seems to me that these seven roles create enough possible scenarios that we do not need to keep careful track of the war on the ground. Even in a huge WWII campaign game there should be plenty for the navies to do without the players driveing around tanks and squads of soldiers.
<P>I suggest we create a very simple form of ground combat, something like Supreme Ruler or even Sim City, to be used in campaign games. The simulation will keep track of numerical odds, and occasionally send the players a message like "Iwo Jima is under attack! Enemy forces are superior by 1,000,000 tons of troops and supplies!"
