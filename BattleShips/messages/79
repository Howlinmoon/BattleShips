<P>Actually the ships WILL turn right...<br> The problem is - right now I am merely comparing the two degrees - course and desired_course. If course > desired_course I subtract at most 20 degrees each impulse to bring course == desired_course. Unfortunately - at the moment if current course is 359 degrees and desired course is 1 degree - the ship will turn left 358 degrees. Or - if the current course is 1 degree and the desired course is 359 degrees - then the ship will turn right 358 degrees. I'll fix this later today.
