<P>Course changes are now operational - somewhat. At this moment the ships are only turning LEFT - no matter that a right turn would be quicker... I will fix this later - for now it IS working - refresh the ship status page every 20 seconds to watch...<p> <B>NOTE AT THIS TIME ONLY SPECIFY DESIRED COURSE IN DEGREES</b><p> Later I will implement a target X,Y and a target Ship_ID as parameters.
