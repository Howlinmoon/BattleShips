<P>Task Force Status Update<br> You can now create task forces - AND add ships to them/remove ships from them. You CAN NOT remove a task force yet.<br> Still need to add waypoints/rallypoint for taskforces - which requires messing with the current waypoint code to pause conventional waypoint following. Look for that tomorrow...
