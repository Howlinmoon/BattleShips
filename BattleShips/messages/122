<P>> I right now have two arrays - one is called $number_waypoints[ship_id],
<BR>&gt; when the impulser is first fired up this value is read from the sql
<BR>&gt; server and contains how many waypoints each individual ship has.
<BR>&gt; [SNIP]
<BR>&gt; Currently the contents of the array is packed in a fashion similar
<BR>&gt; to this "100:200:0:25", what this means is that this particular
<BR>&gt; waypoint is at 100,200, a depth of 0 and a speed change of 25.
<P>This is a good way to do it.
<P>&gt; - during the course of an impulse - all of the ship ids are ran through
<BR>&gt; a loop and if $number_waypoints[$current_ship] > 0, then the waypoint
<BR>&gt; (x,y value) for $waypoint[$current_ship][1] is extracted and the ships
<BR>&gt; course is adjusted to aim at this destination just as if the player
<BR>&gt; used the modify course routine.
<P>This has a lot of advantages, but computation conservation is not one of them! If the server can handle it, then fine. I definitely like the fine course correction and up-to-date ETA calculation.
<P>&gt; It is then compared to the last calculated distance. If it is GREATER
<BR>&gt; than the last calculated distance - for my intents and purposes -
<BR>&gt; we have arrived at our destination. (so we actually overshot it slightly
<P>It might be a good idea to check absolute range to waypoint . . . if the range is < about 5 then assume we have arrived. If it is 10,000 then assume the ship is still assuming its new course.
<P>This system will make navigation much more precise at low speeds than at high speeds. Now that you mention it, this is probably a good idea. If you want to bring a ship in to port, YOU MUST assign it a waypoint outside the port at cruising speed, then assign it a docking space waypoint at low speed < 5 knots where it will stop. If a ship is in Honolulu and you assign it a docking space in San Diego with no waypoint in between, it will hit the dock at full speed and try to stop on a dime!
