<P>> - I still dont think I have hit apon that magic color just yet. Suggestions
<BR>&gt; appreciated.
<P>This is a tough one, since the top of the picture is so light and the bottom is so dark. I have no idea what color to suggest.
<P>However, for your further viewing pleasure, there are some nice B&W pictures available <A HREF = "http://www.teleport.com/~chalu/ships.htm">here</A>. I look at them sometimes for inspiration.
