<P>> Also - the seaview discovered a problem -
<P>Glad to be of service. :-)
<P>&gt; Now during lunch today I shall take a stab at
<BR>&gt; incorporating a Task Force management page that
<BR>&gt; will allow you to create and delete Task Forces
<BR>&gt; - plus assign ships to them.
<P>I'm not sure what you have in mind for this. I vaguely remember that there were a bunch of standard formations and standard maneuvers for TFs, but I only remember a few of them. The formation I remember was all ships in a straight line, like this:
<P>- - - - - - - -
<P>or this:
<P>| | | | | | | |
<P>And the maneuvers I remember were this type of turn:
<P>__ __ __ __ __
<P>|
<P>|
<P>and this type of turn:
<P>\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
