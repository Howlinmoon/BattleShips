<P>I'm trying to recreate the information I had 15 years ago about how battlefleets/task forces make their maneuvers. I have not been successful yet. However I did find out some stuff about convoys.
<P>During both WWI and WWI, convoys were arranged in rectangular formations. There rectangles consisted of columns of ships that ran parallel to each other and travelled at speds of 8-12 knots. On our scale, ships in the same column were a mere two pixels apart (400 yards)! Distance between columns was usually four pixels (800 yards).
<P>The zig-zag turns that convoys made were a standard 45 degrees (not 90 as I had thought). Apparently this was kept as a fairly rigid standard to prevent convoy ships from colliding with each other. To make the zig-zag maneuver effective in thwarting U-boat attacks, the *timing* of the turns was varied, not the arc of turn.
