<P>Erm,<p> Contrary to what Eric believes - I did not write "MyAdmin" I happened to find it the other day and thought it might be useful. Did you think I was making all of those outrageous spelling errors it has?<br> <p> Actually - it was just thrown up as an experiment - I'm working on implementing and better and more useful www front end (no - not writing this one either) as soon as I figure out how to install php3 on my Apache httpd server. ASP blows so dont even suggest it.<br> <p> As for Oracle - so far it still lives on the free CDROM I got - I somehow just can't bring myself to turn over 10% of beholder's drivespace to one application.<br> Last year this machine was P100 24megs of ram and about 5gigs hd space - now it's a K6-2 333Mhz, 80Megs of ram and dual 5gig hard drives...<br>
