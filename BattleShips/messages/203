<P>I added a dozen ships to the the game - and quickly saw that I need to work fast on making something similar to TFs - except for Convoys. I'm going to represent ALL of the ships (merchantile) in a convoy with one entry in the ship status page - to reduce the clutter.<br> In the meantime - I decided to treat any ship that belongs to a tf with the word "convoy" in it as a special case - or I did until I saw the tf page was still in the same shambles I left it in last week ;-) Argh!
