<P>As I showed in the above post, a really tall Battleship (the Bismark was almost 100 feet tall) might be able to see another really tall battleship as far away as 23.4 nautical miles (234 pixels).
<P>The Arado Ar 196 aircraft carried by the Bismark had a service ceiling of 22,965 feet. This was modest by WWII standards, but still high enough to have a horizon 177.3 nautical miles away! Thus by launching its aircraft, the Bismark could locate British convoys 1,773 pixels away (in good weather). This is even farther than today's ships can see with their shipborne radar. It takes an AWACS or a sattelite to see farther than that.
