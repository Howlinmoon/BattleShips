<P>
<BR>&gt; Task Force Waypoints are NOT yet possible. Running into
<BR>&gt; a logistics problem - deciding what to do if the ship
<BR>&gt; belonging to a task force has it's own waypoints.
<BR>&gt; I will probably toss any personal waypoints out and
<BR>&gt; swap in the task force's waypoints. Right now a task
<BR>&gt; force waypoint is merely a way of giving ALOT of ships
<BR>&gt; at one time personal waypoints. So this is probably how
<BR>&gt; it will remain.
<P>I think this is all you need. Once a TF has "rallied," being a part of a TF <i>should</I> mean just accepting waypoints en mass. Typically the TF will all make the same maneuvers as the lead ship. Would you like me to help write a function that would accept the paremeters (ship_position_in_TF, type_of_turn, lead_ship_waypoint_X, lead_ship_waypoint_Y) and return (ship_waypoint_X, ship_waypoint_Y)?
