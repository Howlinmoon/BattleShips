<P>Jim is right, the operations leading up to a battle like Midway would have to start days or weeks before the battle itself. All I can say is that this leaves us the possibility of many different scenarios for a single battle.
<P>You could have "Tactical Midway" in which both players are given victory conditions, ships, and a narrow region in which to place them at the start of the game. This game would be a lot like a wargame scenario, and it could be over in 4-6 hours.
<P>Then you could have "Grand Tactical Midway" in which the players get to "buy" their ships and decide on their own objectives. Victory would be decided by a point total after a predetermined amount of time has passed, say a weekend.
<P>Finally, you could have a "Strategic Midway" campaign which starts with all the forces of both sides in the position they historically had a week before the battle. Players could deploy their fleets however they like, and any number of battles might take place before victory is declaired.
<P>Between WWI and WWII this leaves us the possibility of well over 100 relatively short scenarios.
