<P>
<BR>&gt; Speaking of Supreme Ruler - that reminds me - we need to take
<BR>&gt; something into account that we did'nt need to worry about for
<BR>&gt; G.O. - namely weather.
<P>Yes, we need to account for both weather and time of day. Weather is especially critical for aircraft carriers. While Jutland was able to take place during foggy, crummy weather Midway and Pearl Harbor could only happen in clear, sunny weather.
<P>This brings up a VERY critical point. Should we use "simulated" weather for campaign games, where random number generators create occasional rain, fog, snow, and such? Or should we try to use REAL weather? That would mean some SERIOUS research! Imagine trying to find weather records for every part of every ocean on every day during WWI and WWII! That would be an enormous task!
<P>It would also throw offf the balance of play, since players could look at the same meterological records. The first day of WWI they would already know exactly what the weather would be like on the last day of the war!
<P>If we institute random weather then the weather itself could change history. What if there is a hurricane on the day the Battle of Midway is supposed to happen? In a short scenario we could "force" the weather, but in a long campaign the future of the world might be dictated by our random weather generator . . .
