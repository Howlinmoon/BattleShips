<P>> with no scaling factor needed, since the scale is 1:1. You calculate
<BR>&gt; "view coordinates" for every entity in the galaxy and display
<BR>&gt; them. Some languages are smart enough to ignore commands to display
<BR>&gt; ponts that are off the screen. If this one isn't, then you will need
<BR>&gt; to error trap. <p> I just modified the my scaling factor to a value 1000x larger than it was. This in effect zoomed the map in 1000x and resulted in about 1/2 dozen blips appearing on the map total. I think this was a conclusive test that java will happily discard plots that are out of bounds. <p> I have since put the map back to normal...
