<P>Have you made any progress with the Oracle 8! I might be able to get lots of DBA tools for this. Just a thought!
<P>&gt; OK - I made a table using this utility. Are there more features
<BR>&gt; such as having it create scripts for all the table in a database.
<BR>&gt; I cannot see using this utility to create masses of tables and then
<BR>&gt; change them due to additional requirements. No doubt an improvement!
<BR>&gt; And for now this is great. :)
<P>&gt; Oh yes I am back also!
