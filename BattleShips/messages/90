<P>I worked on stamping out the bugs in my ship deletion routine - and now it seems to finally be working fine. Deleting a ship in the middle of the list will shuffle the order downward by one.<p> I also tweaked the ship speed modifier slightly to change the speed per impulse by 5 instead of 1. And there are links now at the ends of some results pages back to the ship status screen.
