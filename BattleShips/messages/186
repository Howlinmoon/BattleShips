<P>> . . . if the Bismark's main guns hit the Hood with seven shells in
<BR>&gt; an impulse, then those four fields will be exactly the same for all
<BR>&gt; seven shots_hit.
<P>&gt; It's fine with me if you want to keep track of individual shells
<BR>&gt; instead of grouping them into volleys. <p> Good - it's settled then - I'll keep track of individual shots and toss the concept of volleys out. Remember - the impulser does'nt mind processing 1 shot or a 1000 shots - it's not like I'm doing this by hand - in which case the volley idea would be a good one...
