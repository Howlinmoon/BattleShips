<P>This weekend on the History Channel I caught a show called "Battleships" I think, and watching it made me yearn for a WWII era Naval game. It's amazing that you would mention something similar. Ever since the Coco era - I have been wanting to write the computer equivalent of "Submarine!" I think it would be way cool to organize convoys and escorts and try to get them across the pond... We could simply create a nice ocean in 3d more or less as the map - and have a much simpler detailed land mass(es) surrounding it. Hmmm - maybe make the countries (players) as Islands in the sea? They'd have to be BIG islands tho to generate an economy that could support a nice WWII era Navy. And it would give us a chance to experiment with a Navy that specialized in Destroyer tactics - over one that preferred pigboats. Of course then you could have your King David class Battlewagon which with one shot from it's 9 25" guns - sinks itself!
