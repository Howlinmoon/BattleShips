<P>
<BR>&gt; engine power and current speed. A hulk like the bismark going full
<BR>&gt; ahead is going to have a much larger turning radius than a small PT
<BR>&gt; boat just trolling along... You come up with a formula - I'll implement
<BR>&gt; it ;-)
<P>Okay, that's a deal!
<P>I came up with the formula for heading & bearing on Tuesday, but then my computer crashed (damn Microsoft) before I submitted it. I was out all day yesterday and won't be around much today or tomorrow, but I'll try to recreate it ASAP.
<P>BTW yesterday I discovered that I have somebody's Battlewagon set. I think it is Dave's. Dave, if you read this you can have it back whenever you like.
<P>I played an hour or so of Bismark and Prinz Eugen vs Hood and POW. If you ignore the typos, Battlewagon has some good data on gunnery and armor. While the accuracy part stinks, the range, penetration, and armor data could be used as an initial framework very nicely. I know that Task Force got their original data out of a book on Battleships, and later we can use the same book to create even better gunnery rules.
<P>Anyone feel like getting together for a little Battlewagon some time?
