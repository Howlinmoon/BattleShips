* What is a good combination of characters to choose for my adventure?
* All characters have useful attributes, but the trick is to form a balanced team.  It is not recommended to choose two characters of similar abilities.  Try characters from different classes.

* Why is my only difficulty option NOVICE?
* The higher levels are only accessible after your characters gain experience by completing the previous difficulty level.  It will be necessary for you to have level 20 characters before being able to choose Expert level, and level 35 characters before choosing Master.

* Why do I keep losing my Saved Games?
* If you are using the Quiksave function (Q), there is only one game slot available for this function.  This file is over-written every time you press Q.  It is in your best interest to use the New Save or Update Save functions periodically preserve several save files from which to choose.

* Why can't I save a multiplayer game?
* The game is only saved upon leaving the game.  The last person to leave will have a save game file stored automatically upon exiting the game.  In order to continue this saved multiplayer game, the last player to exit must host the next game.

* There are locations on my Locations list but when I select them, I am told that this location is not accessible yet.  Why?
* Locations appear on this list when they have been discovered in the game.  If there is something blocking your path to the location at the moment, you will not be able to select it.  Check for doors that have been closed or your second character blocking a doorway.

* I am having problems with multiplayer games using HEAT.NET.
* Any problem with the HEAT.NET site or software should be directed to the technical support staff of www.heat.net.

* I heard an item drop to the ground after clicking on an object, but I can't find it.
* Objects can be hidden by debris on the ground.  Try panning the camera and using different zoom levels to locate the object.  Also look near the base of any walls nearby.  You may also want to pass your cursor over the area and look for an object description to appear on the text bar.

* What am I supposed to do with the scrolls, rings, and amulets I have that do not have attributes assigned to them?
* These can have any magic spell that your character poses assigned to them.  To assign a spell to a scroll, select the spell then right click on the scroll.  To assign magic to rings, amulets, and even weapons or armor, you must also have a rune.  Assign the magic to the rune as you would assign it to a scroll.  Then select the rune and click it on the ring, amulet, etc.

* My spell level is listed as 1/8, what does this mean?
* This means that you are level 1 for that spell out of a possible 8.  To increase, you must read another book of that particular spell either after finding or purchasing it.

* Why does a bar appear across my mana indicator when I left click on it?
* This bar limits how much mana can be used by the character for casting spells automatically.  The currently active spell will be cast automatically when needed, provided the spell does not require more mana than is available above the bar.

* How do I use the Forester skill?
* If you have the Forester skill, you may be able to locate food in water or forested areas by right clicking in your vicinity.  The higher your skill level, the better your chances of locating food in those areas.

* What do the numbers mean that fly from the enemies during combat?
* This is the amount of damage you are causing with each hit.  If a "1" is displayed, the enemy is not being injured by the weapon you are using.

* Atenus wants a magic potion, but I used the ones I found in the level.  What do I do now?
* See if Elmeric has one to sell you, or try giving Atenus something else.
